# The ambiguity effect

The *ambiguity* effect is a cognitive bias where decision making is affected by a lack of information.
People tend to select options for which the probability of a favorable outcome is known, over an option for which the probability of a favorable outcome is unknown. 

The effect was first described by Daniel Ellsberg in 1961.
